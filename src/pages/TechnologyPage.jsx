        <p>
          A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used
          to carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth
          orbit or beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in
          operation. Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight
          on the launch pad!
